# 📊 **Reece Calvin - Baseball Data Analyst**

🏢 **Current Position**: Data Analyst at Hiroshima Carp (July 2023 - Present)

🧠 **About Me**:
I'm Reece Calvin, a baseball data scientist with a passion for solving the mysteries of the game. My journey through the professional world of baseball has taken me to fascinating places, and here are some of the highlights:

📈 **Performance Turnaround Artist**:
With the Hiroshima Carp, I was tasked with finding the cause of a player's rapid decline in hitting skills. Through thorough analysis, I not only identified the problem but also suggested a correction that catapulted the player's wRC+ from a career low to high.

⚾ **Strategy Optimization**:
I do not just like numbers; I like strategy too. I crafted offensive and pitching+defensive regression models that became a guide for maximizing runs. It was this sort of precision that led to the teams unforseen success.

📡 **High Proficiency with Rapsodo and Hawk-Eye**:
In both my work with Northeastern and the Carp, I worked extensivly with the data provided by Rapsodo and Hawk-Eye. I turned raw data into actionable insights, supplying coaches with individualized player assessments.

🎓 **Continuous Learning**:
My journey began at Northeastern University, class of '25, where I am working towards a Bachelor's in Data Science and Economics. Courses in Machine Learning and Statistics laid the foundation for my career.

⚙️ **Tech Toolbox**:
Python and SQL are my coding skills. I use them to create advanced machine learning models and innovative metrics like xRV (Barrel Dependent Expected Run Value). My work bridges the gap between theory and on-field excellence.

🔓 **Puzzle Solver**:
In the world of baseball, I try to identify and solve problems. I've developed MLB and NPB pitch graders, fine-tuned with a 5-Fold Cross-Validated R2 score between 0.03 and 0.05. I have leveraged my strengths into devoping a model to predict pitch run values. Even more-so, I scrutinize my own models to avoid common mistakes such as over fitting.

📊 **Markov Chain Maverick**:
My Markov Chain-based lineup optimizer is a game-changer. It factors in pitcher and batter at-bat distributions, normalizing for defense and situation. It's a strategic compass for coaches.
