# 📊 **Reece Calvin - Baseball Data Analyst**

🏢 **Current Position**: Data Analyst at Hiroshima Carp (July 2023 - Present)

🧠 **About Me**:
I'm Reece Calvin, a baseball data scientist with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the game. My journey through the data-driven world of baseball has taken me to fascinating places, and here are some of the highlights:

📈 **Performance Turnaround Artist**:
At Hiroshima Carp, I faced the challenge of deciphering a player's rapid decline in hitting skills. With data as my guide, I not only identified the problem but also suggested a correction that catapulted the player's wRC+ from a career low to a career high.

⚾ **Optimization Maestro**:
I'm not just a numbers person; I'm a strategist too. I crafted offensive and pitching+defensive regression models that became the secret sauce for maximizing runs. The team's success was no accident; it was data-driven precision.

📡 **Data Wizardry with Rapsodo and Hawk-Eye**:
In my quest for precision, I harnessed the power of Rapsodo and Hawk-Eye data. I turned raw data into actionable insights, supplying coaches with individualized player assessments. Standardizing and cleaning Hawk-Eye datasets was all in a day's work.

🎓 **Continuous Learning**:
My journey began at Northeastern University, class of '25, where I am working towards a Bachelor's in Data Science and Economics. Courses in Machine Learning and Algorithms laid the foundation for my career.

⚙️ **Tech Toolbox**:
Python and SQL are my trusty companions. I wield them to create advanced machine learning models and innovative metrics like xRV (Barrel Dependent Expected Run Value). My work bridges the gap between theory and on-field excellence.

🔓 **Puzzle Solver**:
In the world of baseball, I'm the puzzle solver. I've developed MLB and NPB pitch graders, fine-tuned with a 5-Fold Cross-Validated R2 score between 0.03 and 0.05. My expertise lies in predicting pitch run values, making every pitch count. Even more-so, I scrutinize my own models to avoid common mistakes such as over fitting.

📊 **Markov Chain Maverick**:
My Markov Chain-based lineup optimizer is a game-changer. It factors in pitcher and batter at-bat distributions, normalizing for defense and situation. It's a strategic compass for coaches.
